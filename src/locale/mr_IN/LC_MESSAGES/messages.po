"Why a programming event by LitCafe? Well, because this is a contest which "
"requires you to write your code in Shakespeare’s Programming Language, an "
"esoteric language which has its syntax resembling Shakespearean plays. The "
"character in the play are variables, and the interactions between the "
"characters onstage delineates interactions between these variables.\n"

"\n"
"Now, this contest is not just about getting a correct answer, it’s about "
"creating an interesting and entertaining play while doing so. So though the "
"problems might seem simple, they carry only 30% of the score, and the "
"remaining 70% will go to your creativity in the story, the dialogue and the "
"characterisation, i.e, the comments! References to the characters’ "
"Shakespearean companions or tales will fetch you extra points, too!\n"
